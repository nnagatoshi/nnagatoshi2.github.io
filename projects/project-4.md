summary: My group and I were tasked with making a mobile app. 
---
We decided to make an app about camping in the national parks. We had to make a proposal for the app and pretend like we were presenting this to a tech company. I was tasked with the technology problem solving, for example, figuring out how to track the GPS signal within the park. We also planned on having a website attached to the app so it would be easy to access the database.
