In my ICS 111 class we were tasked with making a game and I choose inverse Tic Tac Toe. The goal of the game being that you had to get your opponent to get three in a row. I was unable to put together the parts but what I was able to complete was having onclick events to the interface. One of the difficulties I was encountering was I had to rewrite the code multiple times because I kept making normal Tic Tac Toe.
